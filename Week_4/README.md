# Code Activity - Wallpaper this discussion board

Code an Animated Wallpaper:

Using the code for drawing and for generating an animation seen so far create an Animated Wallpaper of various shapes and patterns.

- Make it use some randomness and some procedural elements
- Make it tunable by changing a few simple parameters
- Use transformations to achieve most of the elements â€“ (rotations,
  translations and possibly deformations of the patterns).
- To be eligible for full marks use some data from [eif-research.feit.uts.edu.au]()
  to generate the objects or patterns in the wallpaper. Here is
  [an example](https://canvas.uts.edu.au/courses/24942/pages/data-access-example).

**Deliverables:** a video showing simple variations of the wallpaper, alongside the code used to produce the video.

**Groupwork:** This is an INDIVIDUAL exercise - please post to the board INDIVIDUALLY.

**Submission:** Post your submission on this **discussion board**. Please don't post only links or uploaded files - please embed the video/image so everyone can see it on this discussion board without having to open another browser window. Also post the code as monospaced ('Preformatted' style) text or as an attachment if it is too large (>300 lines).

**Peer Reviews:** You will be asked to do 2 peer reviews after the submission date. Please contribute thoughtful and constructive critical analysis of your peer's code and artefact.
