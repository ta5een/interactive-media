# Code Activity - Code a Cat

Based on the code you have been working with in chapter 2, write some Processing code which draws a simple cat.

- You should probably do a basic pencil and paper sketch of a cat first to get an idea of the shapes to use and where to position them.
- Try to keep your code as easy to read as possible by naming your parameters (ie using named variables), and using the names rather than hard-coded numbers.
- The cat drawing should have at least two parameters that allows to change cat's shape.
- Post your code here together with a couple of pictures showing variations changing parameters. **Don't post links or files or especially zip files - include the whole image so we can see it in the post without needing to download it.**

**Deliverables:** a couple of images showing variations of the parameters, alongside the code used to produce the image.

**Groupwork:** This is an INDIVIDUAL exercise - please post to the board INDIVIDUALLY.

**Submission:** Post your submission on this discussion board. Please don't post only links or uploaded files - please embed the video/image so everyone can see it on this discussion board without having to open another browser window. Also post the code as monospaced ('Preformatted' style) text or as an attachment if it is too large (>300 lines).

**Peer Reviews:** You will be asked to do 2 peer reviews after the submission date. Please contribute thoughtful and constructive critical analysis of your peer's code and artefact.
