# Code Activity - Animate the mouse pointer

Based on the code you have been working with in chapter 2, write some Processing code which draws to follow the mouse pointer and animates it on the basis of on the basis of some key commands.

- You will need to have a way of getting the location to draw at. You may wish to avoid snapping right to the mouse pointer location and allow some easing to the location. What you draw is up to you.
- Whatever you draw at the mouse pointer location might want to have some physical or emotional response to whether movements of the mouse are fast, slow or have any other clear characteristics. The animated drawing that follows the mouse pointer may also have some complexity and give an indication of where it's been.
- No other visual elements are required or assessed in this assignment, only what you draw at the mouse pointer location. No frames, or other elements are required.
- You may wish to use key commands to alter certain factors. These key commands may be instantaneous, may toggle something on or off, may increase or decrease a value, may only turn something on when pressed down, or a combination of the above or something else.
- Try to keep your code as easy to read as possible by naming your parameters (ie using named variables), and using the names rather than hard-coded numbers.
- Post your code here together with a couple of pictures showing variations changing parameters. **Don't post links or files or especially zip files - include the whole image so we can see it in the post without needing to download it.**

**Deliverables:** some short animated gifs or movies to show the animation. Post your code to explain the gifs. A movie is fine as well.

**Groupwork:** This is an INDIVIDUAL exercise - please post to the board INDIVIDUALLY.

**Submission:** Post your submission on this **discussion board**. Please don't post only links or uploaded files - please embed the video/image so everyone can see it on this discussion board without having to open another browser window. Also post the code as monospaced ('Preformatted' style) text or as an attachment if it is too large (>300 lines).

**Peer Reviews:** You will be asked to do 2 peer reviews after the submission date. Please contribute thoughtful and constructive critical analysis of your peer's code and artefact.
