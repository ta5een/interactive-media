# Code Activity - Process an Image

Define at least 2 different effects to apply to an image and make the parameters
for the filters adjustable with mouse or keyboard.

If you can you could modify some of the code to explore some type of an original
effect.

Post a **short 30sec video** showing interactive variation of the filters (embed
the video so we can look at it without downloading or going to another site),
and post the code as monospaced HTML text so we can read it easily.
