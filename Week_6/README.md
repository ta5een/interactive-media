# Code Activity - Develop a graphical user interface for an existing sketch

- You have now used many sketches and may have interacted with them using the
  keyboard and mouse. However, using GUI elements will give you a large number
  of opportunities to change parameters that determine the behaviour of the
  sketch. In this activity we'd like to ask you to find a sketch you like, and
  add a GUI to it.
- Choose a sketch that you like, and look for three particular variables or
  parameters that control the behaviour of the sketch. Investigate a sensible
  range of those parameters by changing the hard coded values and observing the
  behaviour that results. Understand what type of data you are manipulating
  (continuous, integer, selections from a list of possible values etc.).
- Add some GUI elements to the sketch and link them back to the parameters you
  are seeking to manipulate. You should do at least three parameters, but you
  may do as many as you wish.
- Decide on a particular location that is appropriate for the GUI element to be
  placed (you may need to expand the window size to do so). Make sure it is easy
  to manipulate.
- Make sure your GUI elements map to the type of data appropriately.
- Try out your new sketch. Are you able to control the sketch parameters
  satisfactorily or do you find yourself 'blowing up' the sketch too often ? You
  may need to adjust the available range of the parameters.

**Deliverables:** some short animated gifs or movies to show the animation. Post
your code to explain the gifs/movies.

**Groupwork:** This is an INDIVIDUAL exercise - please post to the board
INDIVIDUALLY.

**Submission:** Post your submission on this **discussion board**. Please don't
post only links or uploaded files - please embed the video/image so everyone can
see it on this discussion board without having to open another browser window.
Also post the code as monospaced ('Preformatted' style) text or as an attachment
if it is too large (>300 lines).

**Peer Reviews:** You will be asked to do 2 peer reviews after the submission
date. Please contribute thoughtful and constructive critical analysis of your
peer's code and artefact.
