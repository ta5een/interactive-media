# Code Activity - Audio Synthesis and Control

Using the code for audio generation and loading of samples create a simple
interactive audio application.

- You can play from an existing source, manipulating elements of the sound, or
  synthesize the sound.
- Add some control with the mouse or the keyboard (like simply change the gain
  or add some delay). You will need to consider an appropriate mapping of the
  interaction values to a parameter in the audio chain.

**Deliverables:** a simple video showing variations of the sound. Also post
your code as usual (but the video is more important).

**Groupwork:** This is an INDIVIDUAL exercise - please post to the board
INDIVIDUALLY.

**Submission:** Post your submission on this discussion board. Please don't post
only links or uploaded files - please embed the video/image so everyone can see
it on this discussion board without having to open another browser window. Also
post the code as monospaced ('Preformatted' style) text or as an attachment if
it is too large (>300 lines).
